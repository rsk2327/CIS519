    "## Python/Jupyter Installation Instructions\n",
    "First, make sure you have python3 (version 3.7 is the latest) installed on your local machine.\n",
    "We recommend managing your python installation with Anaconda.\n",
    "The Anaconda website has instructions for how to install python based on your operating system:\n",
    "- https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, make sure that you have Jupyter notebooks installed.\n",
    "It may have already come with your Anaconda installation.\n",
    "If not, the Jupyter website has installation instructions:\n",
    "- http://jupyter.org/install\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used python or Jupyter notebooks before, we recommend bookmarking these resources:\n",
    "- Python: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/\n",
    "- Jupyter: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that the Google tutorial uses python2, so some of their example code may not directly work in python3:\n",
    "- Print statements now require parentheses: `print x` now becomes `print(x)`\n",
    "- No longer need to specify file encoding: `open('file.txt', 'r')` works\n",
    "- The division operator `/` no longer does integer divison: `5 / 2` is `2.5`\n",
    "- The `xrange` operator is now only `range`\n",
    "\n",

    "## About Python\n",
    "Python is a programming language that is very popular among the machine learning research community.\n",
    "It is a higher-level programming language than Java, and has an extensive collection of libraries that can be easily installed.\n",
    "We require that you use python for this class, so it is important to be familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python vs Java\n",
    "- Java is compiled, but Python is not: you directly run the Python file\n",
    "- Java is statically typed (the types of the variables cannot change), and you do not declare types in Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This works in python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "x = \"python\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Instantiating a class in Python does not use `new`\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Assume there is a class called `Person`\n",
    "p = Person('Emily', 25)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Python does not use parentheses, like Java. Instead, it uses whitespace to infer the scope of methods, for loops, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "      print(i * 2)      # Indent by 4 spaces\n",
    "      print(i * 4)\n",
    "print('Done')       # No indent, runs after for loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Functions cannot be overloaded, instead use optional arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "def f(x, y=0.0):\n",
    "      ....\n",
    "f(8)\n",
    "f(8, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Boolean values are now `True` and `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python vs Matlab\n",
    "- Python uses hard brackets `[]` for indexing arrays and matrices instead of `()` in Matlab\n",
    "- Python is 0-indexed, so the first item in a list is at index 0, not 1\n",
    "- Python doesn't come by default with a full development tool, like Matlab\n",
    "- The `numpy` library in Python implements many of the same matrix functionality that Matlab has\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Environments\n",
    "- In this class we will use Jupyter Notebooks, which is one of many ways you can write python code. We feel that Jupyter Notebooks are a simple, but effective tool.\n",
    "- Other options include:\n",
    "  - Text editors: Atom, Sublime\n",
    "  - PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\n",
    "  - Google Collaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com/ \n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",

    "```\n",
    "Once the server has started, open up a web browser and go to http://localhost:8888.\n",
    "You should see a file tree, which you can use to navigate to where you want to save your Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allow you to interactively develop python code.\n",
    "Cells have types, either markdown (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or python code.\n",
    "You can write as much code in a cell as you need.\n",
    "When you want to execute it, enter shift+enter.\n",
    "Anything displayed by your program will be written below the cell.\n",
    "Variables that are defined within an executed cell are saved in memory and can be used later (similar behavior in Matlab).\n",
    "It's similar to if you could pause the program execution.\n",
    "Code within other cells can reference any cell _which has already been executed_.\n",
    "If you have already run a cell and you edit its code, the cell needs to be rerun in order for your changes to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you close the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to rerun all of the cells from scratch so the variables and methods will be redefined. **Make sure you save before you close the notebook!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting assignments\n",
    "Your Jupyter Notebook can be downloaded as a python file that can be run under File -> Download -> Python .py.\n",
    "You should turn in this python file and **not** the `.ipynb` file."
